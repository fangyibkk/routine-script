Setup repos to learn new thing like new library with ES6 requires a lot of headers. For example, in React.js we need webpack configuration file, babel to transpile the file and surely index.html. Many times this hinder us from trying new thing or checking an existing assumption. We tend to stuck with the existing repos comment/uncomment stuff to diagnose thing. Hold on. More often than not large repos means largeindependent variables. Why not kick off small project and test something for a while? You will then copy the working stuff back to the repos. It's more light weight and a good way to debug.
